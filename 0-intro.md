# ES2020â€Š - The Latest JavaScript Edition 

Back in the early days I taught myself HTML5, CSS3 and PHP dreaming to built the next facebook. Later on, I realized Python is even cooler than PHP. So I broke-up with PHP and started flirting with Python. Then I got engaged with it  

I have been primarily working with JavaScript for around 4 years now. My co-workers and colleagues think that I am an expert in this language. Yet I think I only know few things about it. Because I didn't really cared about it too much. I just learned few things on the go to get my job done. 


I decided to dig deeper into the JavaScript language by reading the latest language specification ES2020 which was released a few days ago.
As I read, I will share what I have learned so far. I will start with the basics and try to simplify things as much as possible. This will be especially helpful for new JavaScript programmers to learn the most up-to-date language, and also experienced programmers to review and catch-up with the latest features.
